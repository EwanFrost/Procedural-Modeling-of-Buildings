# Procedural-Modeling-of-Buildings
The project was our course project and related with Computer Graphics Animation. 
The idea of project was to model 3D objects and visualize it by using 
"Procedural Modeling" approach (http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2006.SG.Mueller.ProceduralModelingOfBuildings.final.pdf)​
We were four people (Me, Vugar, Sebastian and Alexandra). 
It was consist of three parts(parsing, modeling, visualization) and the main responsibilities were.
  1. Preparing grammar rules for buildings
  2. Parsing those rules and sending output to Modeling part
  3. Creating derivation tree in modeling and sending output to visualization 
  4. Visualizing the 3D shapes
  I was in Modeling part and it was the hardest. 
  Technologies that were used: Visual Studio, C++, Open GL. 1. Preparing grammar rules for buildings  ​                                   2.
